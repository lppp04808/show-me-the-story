3. Each chapter outline must cover, in order: opening scene/location; core conflict or goal; key turning point; characters appearing (with roles); chapter ending or hook.
4. Prefer [Registered characters]. Add unlisted characters only when necessary; mark their debut with "first appearance" plus a one-line role/relationship, and never in an earlier chapter.
5. One-time events such as first meetings and identity reveals must happen in exactly one chapter — never repeat them.

4. One-time events already played out (first meetings, identity reveals, relationships established) must be treated as established facts and never re-enacted in this chapter.
5. Do not re-summarise the story-so-far. Open straight into this chapter's scene. If a previous-chapter ending is provided, your opening must seamlessly continue its setting, time, and mood without re-establishing what's already there.
6. Each character's dialogue must match their established voice; do not let everyone sound alike.
7. Drive the plot with concrete action, sensory detail, and dialogue. Avoid abstract, summarising narration.
8. Close on a natural cliffhanger or emotional hook. Do not write meta lines like "to be continued".
9. Keep the narrative POV strictly consistent: follow [Narrative POV] throughout; do not switch person or viewpoint subject unless the POV spec explicitly allows alternation.

[Character beats] Characters that appear and how their relationships move. Explicitly note one-time events such as "A and B meet for the first time" or "B's identity is revealed". If nothing changes, write "no new progress".
[Psychological arc] The protagonist's current mental state, emotional tone, and any pivotal internal turn.
[State changes] What changed about the protagonist (outward: appearance/clothing/behaviour; inward: attitude/perception) compared to the previous chapter. If nothing changed, write "carries over from previous chapter".

1. Character names or honorifics inconsistent with prior text.
2. Timeline contradictions (e.g. previous text ended at night, this chapter inexplicably reverts to morning of the same day).
3. Facts that directly contradict established events (a dead character reappearing without explanation, a destroyed object intact again).
4. Character abilities or identity directly clashing with established setting.
5. Premature introduction of characters, first meetings, identity reveals, or other events that the outline assigns to later chapters.

Notes:

1. Each foreshadow should serve the main plot or character arc, not exist for mystery's sake.
2. Each foreshadow has a clear "plant point" (chapter it is seeded) and "payoff point" (chapter where it is expected to be resolved).
3. Foreshadows may interconnect into a web of clues.
4. Vary the types: objects, hinted dialogue, environmental detail, contradictions in behaviour, unexplained phenomena, etc.
5. Spread payoff points across different chapters; do not cluster them.
6. Foreshadows can begin as early as chapter 1, but most should be planted in the middle and paid off in the latter half.
